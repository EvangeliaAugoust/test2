            <p>
                TicketFlix is a web-based platform that allows users to browse movies, book tickets, and manage their cinema experiences 
                from their desktop. Designed for an intuitive and structured browsing experience, the website makes it easy to explore movies, 
                compare options, and complete bookings effortlessly.

            <span class="subhead"><p>The Goal</p></span>

                Enhancing the movie-booking experience with a user-friendly web platform optimized for desktop browsing. The website offers an 
                efficient way to discover movies, select showtimes, and secure tickets while providing a clear and accessible interface.

            <span class="subhead"><p>Secondary Research</p></span>
            <p>Through my secondary research, I focused on understanding whether a web-based ticketing system for booking movie tickets would 
                be effective and how it compares to mobile applications. According to a published paper titled <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4841210" target="_blank" class="elink">'A Case Study on Online Ticket Booking System Project'</a> 
                it was found that users often prefer a web-based system due to <b>its ease of use and comprehensive features,</b> such as detailed information on movie 
                details, reviews, and other relevant movie details. This makes the booking process <b>more informative and straightforward,</b> as opposed to 
                mobile apps, which some users find complicated and uncomfortable to navigate. In fact, the study suggests that while mobile apps are widely 
                available, many users feel uneasy using them for ticket bookings, further emphasizing the preference for web-based platforms.

            <p>I've written an usability study moderated interview script and recorded the characteristics a participant should have in a cohesive google doc,
                among other factors that played into the creation of this project including KPI's and project goals.

            <ol class="set">
                <li>The prompts I've tasked participating user with are: </li>
                <li>1. From the home screen, create a profile.</li>
                <li>2. Choose Thessaloniki to locate available films in cinemas.</li>
                <li>3. Select a cinema to see the available film screenings.</li>
                <li>4. Select the available movies for the upcoming weekend and choose the first movie.</li>
                <li>5. Book 2 tickets for March 14 at 9 pm.</li>
                <li>6. Choose seats in row C.</li>
                <li>7. Finally, confirm your order and complete the payment process, saving your payment card for future use.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>After conducting the usability study, where participants were asked to complete the tasks outlined in the prompts, I documented their responses in a structured format.
                You can view the detailed results for each prompt <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eK7x_77LpEJcxzzMv0PO_GQYOcPQPNnt/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=113364369869409171004&rtpof=true&sd=true" target="_blank" class="elink">here</a>.
                <br> Based on these responses, I synthesized my findings into actionable insights and prioritized them based on how negatively they impact the users' flow.

                        <li>&bullet; The filters on the home screen are too small, making them difficult to read and interact with. Their size and font should be increased for better visibility. Additionally, selected and unselected filters should be more distinguishable.</li>
                        <li>&bullet; Instead of placing the QR code on the confirmation screen, it may be more beneficial to add it to the "Orders → Upcoming" section. Once the booking is complete, a notification could alert users that their new ticket is now available there.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br/>

                    <ul>
                        <li>&bullet; The confirmation screen could include an "Add to Google Wallet / Apple Wallet" button alongside the existing "Download Ticket" option for a smoother experience.</li>

            <span class="subhead"><p>Style Guide</p></span>
            <p>After conducting usability study and iterating on my digital wireframes, I started thinking more about the typeface, color,
                and components I will be needing for mockups. Thus, I created a style guide to help my design process become more intuitive and efficient. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The style guide I cultivated for the app reflected this with the inclusion of complementary mix of serif and san serif typeface and rounded/stylistic form.

            <span class="subhead"><p>Mockups and High-Fidelity Prototype</p></span>
            <p>With these insights I was ready to start thinking about the visual details. I created a mood board keeping to a neutral brown and beige. 
                I wanted the app to exude a regal look with a touch of modern to entice users to actively visit museums.

                <br/>
                <br/>
                Overall, I've learned so much from this project, having the Google's UX Design Certificate Courses guide me through each step of the process. 
                I’ve gained valuable insights into the importance of user feedback and usability testing. These processes are crucial for identifying pain points, 
                making them indispensable tools in creating a user-centered experience. After several more usability test studies and finalizing design details and 
                more, I would potentially look into seeing if this is a viably publishable app.

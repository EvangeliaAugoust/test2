            <p>
                TicketFlix is a web-based platform that allows users to browse movies, book tickets, and manage their cinema experiences 
                from their desktop. Designed for an intuitive and structured browsing experience, the website makes it easy to explore movies, 
                compare options, and complete bookings effortlessly.

            <span class="subhead"><p>The Goal</p></span>
            <p>
                Enhancing the movie-booking experience with a user-friendly web platform optimized for desktop browsing. The website offers an 
                efficient way to discover movies, select showtimes, and secure tickets while providing a clear and accessible interface.

            <span class="subhead"><p>Secondary Research</p></span>
            <p>Through my secondary research, I focused on understanding whether a web-based ticketing system for booking movie tickets would 
                be effective and how it compares to mobile applications. According to a published paper titled <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4841210" target="_blank" class="elink">'A Case Study on Online Ticket Booking System Project'</a> 
                it was found that users often prefer a web-based system due to <b>its ease of use and comprehensive features,</b> such as detailed information on movie 
                details, reviews, and other relevant movie details. This makes the booking process <b>more informative and straightforward,</b> as opposed to 
                mobile apps, which some users find complicated and uncomfortable to navigate. In fact, the study suggests that while mobile apps are widely 
                available, many users feel uneasy using them for ticket bookings, further emphasizing the preference for web-based platforms.

            <p>I developed a moderated interview script for the usability study and documented the key participant characteristics

                selecting the appropriate typeface, colors, and UI components to ensure a cohesive and user-friendly experience. 
            </p>
            <p>The style guide I developed for the website maintains consistency with the TicketFlix brand while adapting to a larger screen experience. 
                It features a clean and modern sans-serif typeface, a structured yet visually engaging layout, and intuitive UI elements designed for seamless navigation.

            <p>With these insights, I was ready to refine the visual details and bring the TicketFlix website to life. I focused on creating a modern and engaging interface 
                that aligns with the brand’s identity while ensuring a seamless browsing and booking experience. The design incorporates a clean layout, a vibrant yet balanced color palette, and intuitive navigation to enhance user interaction and accessibility.

                <br/>
                Overall, I've learned so much from this project, having the Google's UX Design Certificate Courses guide me through each step of the process. 
                I’ve gained valuable insights into the importance of user feedback and usability testing. These processes are crucial for identifying pain points, 
                making them indispensable tools in creating a user-centered experience. After several more usability test studies and finalizing design details and 
                more, I would potentially look into seeing if this is a viably publishable app.
